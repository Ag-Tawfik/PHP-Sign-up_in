PHP-Sign-up_in Project

is a simple web application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. The purpose of the application is to provide a basic user authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and log in.

Features User registration: Users can create an account by providing a username, email address, and password. User login: Once registered, users can log in to their accounts using their username and password. Password hashing: Passwords are hashed using the bcrypt algorithm for security. Form validation: The registration and login forms are validated on the server-side to prevent errors and enhance security. Session management: User sessions are managed using PHP's built-in session management functions. MySQL database integration: User information is stored in a MySQL database.
